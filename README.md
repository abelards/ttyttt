They're Template-mailing You? Template-mail Them Too!

## The problem
Don't you get enough emails from recruiters, would-be startuppers, or simpley people you don't know?
Aren't you tired to always have the same story, then losing time rewriting it from strach, or finding an old mail?
TTY-TTT is here to help.

## Respect
They're template-mailing you, not caring about you or your time.
You're smarter: template-mailing can be respectful, polite, clear and concise altogether.

You're using the tools of your trade to craft personalized, but largely-common responses.
Gaining time is easing the pain, which in turn means quicker replies.

## Make it personal
